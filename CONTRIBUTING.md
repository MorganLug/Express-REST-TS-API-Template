# How to contribute

If you feel like adding more things to the boilerplate, or completing the tech stack (like `typeorm-postgres` branch adds elements to the `main` branch), you can contribute to the project !

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to the repo](https://github.com/MorganLug/Express-REST-TS-API-Template/labels) with a clear list of what you've done, and why (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Depending on the changes, they need to be on a different branch.

About commits, make sure they are atomic (only 1 feature per commit). Follow [this guideline](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for message formatting.

Thanks !
